# dev-server
Very Simple Development Server based on BrowserSync and http-proxy-middleware.

It proxies api calls to the correct server. Cookies, JWT and other web components work properly.  

#Instructions

1) Put your web files on the folder `.\www`

2) Edit the file `run-server.js` and change your api path and target definition used by the middleware or start file (`index.html`)
